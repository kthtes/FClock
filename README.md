# FClock
This is one of a series of life apps for an imaginary *F Empire*, where **people use hexadecimal**. In F Empire:
1. one day has 10 (or 16 in decimal) hours 
2. one hour has 40 (or 64 in decimal) minutes
3. one minute has 40 (or 64 in decimal) seconds

Based on that, I decided to make a series of life app for the people, and also for **the glory of F Empire**. FClock is the first of that series. It shows a clock in F time.

# Temporary notice
0. For **the glory of F Empire**, this app speaks SwiFt, or Swi15t in decimal.
1. The original project (finished years ago) is missing. 
2. This is a prototyping build, with no art assets in.
3. New features to add: calendar, where one year has 16 months.
